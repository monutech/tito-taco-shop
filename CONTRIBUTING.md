## How to Submit a Pull Request (PR)

### Branching Strategy

- **Master Branch**: The `master` branch is the primary branch where the stable version of the project resides. Never push changes directly to `master`.
- **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix from `master`.

### Steps to Submit a PR

1. **Create a New Branch**: 
   ```sh
   git checkout -b [branch-name] master
   ```
   
2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, enhancements, or bugfixes.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: 
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```
   
4. **Push to Your Fork**: 
   ```sh
   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```
   
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/monutech/tito-taco-shop) and click on "New pull request". Choose your fork and the branch you created, then click "Create pull request".

6. **Describe Your PR**: Provide a concise title and describe what changes you have made.

7. **Wait for Review**: mastertainers will review your PR and may request changes. Be sure to keep an eye on the comments.

If you have questions or need further guidance, feel free to reach out to the mastertainers or raise an issue.
